                    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                        Iâ€™m a passionate <span className="text-white font-semibold">computer science student</span> with a strong interest in
                        <span className="text-orange-400"> machine learning, data science</span>, and
                        <span className="text-orange-400"> full-stack development</span>. My experience spans across building
                        interpretable ML models in the medical field, crafting efficient backend systems, and working on innovative projects like
                        <span className="text-white font-semibold"> MathVenture</span>, which challenges my ability to design scalable, performant applications.

                    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                        I thrive in problem-solving and I'm always willing to pick up new skills and technologies as I do exciting projects. Beyond technical skills, I value
                        <span className="text-orange-400"> clean, maintainable code</span> and user-focused design, ensuring that the solutions I build are
                        not only functional but also <span className="text-white font-semibold"> intuitive</span>.

                Why <span className="text-orange-400">MathVenture?</span>
            </h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 max-w-4xl leading-relaxed font-mono mb-6">
                I made <span className="font-semibold text-orange-500">MathVenture</span> to help students build their
                speed and mental math skills in an interactive and accountable manner. Originally,
                MathVenture was a project made for my brother to improve his mental math skills. I first
                asked him to use <a href="https://arithmetic.zetamac.com" className="text-orange-400 underline">Zetamac</a> (also a very good website),
                but I realized that tracking questions and progress is essential for improvementâ€”thus, MathVenture was born.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 max-w-4xl leading-relaxed font-mono">
                I hope you enjoy using MathVenture as much as I enjoyed making it. It is still a WIP and this is only the first iteration of the project.
                Currently, MathVenture supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division questions with questions generated by a custom math engine made by me :).
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 max-w-4xl leading-relaxed font-mono">
                The next steps include adding dynamic question difficulty, graphs to view overtime progress concisely, improving the UI/UX, and making the website more accessible.
                If you have any suggestions, feedback or are interested in working on the UI/UX for the website, please feel free to <a href="mailto:tej.gumaste@gmail.com" className="text-orange-400 underline">reach out</a> to me.
                I am a college student so any work done would need to be done on a volunteer basis.
